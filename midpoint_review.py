2. 
create 3 different variables with any whole number assined as the value and convert them into a string using the str() constructor.
once you convert them print out the variables. Example: convert 3 to '3'
if you use print(type(<var_name>)) this will print out the type of variable for example x = 3 would print 'int' and x = '3' would print 'str'
'''
num1 = str(3243)
num2 = str(4849)
num3 = str(42069)

print(num1, type(num1))
print(num2)
print(num3)
